I don't imagine there are many 8 or 9 year olds that spend their Saturday evenings watching The New Yankee Workshop on PBS. That's what I did. I think it's because I have always been drawn to building things. Like most kids, I would play with Lego blocks, but I never got around to the pretend part of play. You know, acting out scenes, doing voices for all the little Lego mini figures running around. I would build something, show it to my parents, then tear it down and build something new. I realize I'm probably not unique in that aspect, but it might help explain why I got bit by the woodworking bug.


Fast forward a few years to a woodworking class in high school. I learned early on that I needed a chance to work with my hands.

There is something amazing about the creative process. There is an idea, and then there is a lot of work, and finally you end up with a product. It's not always a physical product, but it is something that has been *produced*.
