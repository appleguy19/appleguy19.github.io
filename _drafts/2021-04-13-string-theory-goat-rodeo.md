As a woodworker, I feel a certain connection to my tools. Of course, I engage with my tools on an intellectual level. Like how to use them properly, the materials, the tolerances, etc. But I can also engage with them on an emotional level. For example, I _really_ enjoy using my Tite-Mark Gauge. It is so well created that I have **feelings** about it. _Note: feelings 'about' not 'for'_ ðŸ˜³
It must be similar for musicians too, as I was captivated watching and listening to these gifted musicians talk about their 'tools'.
