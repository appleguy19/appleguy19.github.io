I ❤️ Malcolm Gladwell's Revisionist History podcast. Nearly all of the episodes draw me in. Some of them are heavy and force me to really think. This particular one is crispy yet fluffy. It's about McDonald's changing their method for cooking fries due to public pressure. One day, I hope to try the pre-1990 fries. So McDonald's, if you're listening, I see a clear way to attract people.
