I'm Jake Apple, but you probably already knew that. By trade I'm a project manager at [Secondstreet](http://secondstreet.com). We make audience engagement software.

Outside of work, I have lots of interests and hobbies. My wife says I have too many, and she's right. So I'm trying to focus on one, which is woodworking. Specifically hand tool woodworking.

I also spend a lot of time on the internet. Which is part of the [reason I created this blog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-08-why %})
