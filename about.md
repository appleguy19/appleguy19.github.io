I'm Jake Apple, but you probably already knew that. By trade I'm a Senior Product Manager at [Adalo](https://adalo.com). We make the best no-code ~~mobile~~ app builder. Before that I was at [Secondstreet](https://secondstreet.com) _(acquired)_.

Outside of work, I have lots of interests and hobbies. My wife says I have too many, and she's right. So I'm trying to focus on one, which is woodworking. I have a particular weakness for old handtools. 

I'm also a web person. Which is part of the [reason I created this blog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-08-why %})
