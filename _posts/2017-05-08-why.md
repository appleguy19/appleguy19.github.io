There are a billion blogs out there. Does the internet really need another?

Well, probably not. But I'm going to try anyway. Here's why...

I spend a lot of time learning on the internet. Because of the internet I have learned how to fix carburetors, take apart Macs, install water-powered sump pumps, make websites, diagnose and replace the heating coil in a dryer, build a Nicholson workbench, and so much more. The only reason I was able to do those things is because someone put them out there.

I've taken a lot from my online peers, but rarely have I given back. I think I'm finally ready to contribute.
