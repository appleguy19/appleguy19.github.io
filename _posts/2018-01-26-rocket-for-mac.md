We use [Slack](https://slack.com) at work. Something I've come to love is their emoji autocomplete feature. You start by typing `:` then the name of the emoji you're after. I've been looking for a operating system wide solution for this for some time, and I finally found a good one! If you into this kind of stuff, [Rocket](http://rocket.wolves.fm/r/Bkz1tgYHM) will make you happy.
