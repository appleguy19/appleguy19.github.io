[This](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/europe/norway/christoph-niemann-artist-trip-svalbard-norway/#cover) might be one of my favorite things online. I absolutely adore Christoph Niemann and this animated, beautifully illustrated, and insightful record of his recent trip north was perfectly done. Bonus points for using a web font of his handwriting for the text, so it's still accessible.
