Have you heard about 'Book Nooks'? They're these very cool little combinations of literature, art, and model making. As with most things, there is a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/booknooks/) devoted to these mini worlds hidden on bookshelf. I found this one to be incredible, especially if you've visited the Haunted Mansion at Disney. The attention to detail here is stunning. Enjoy!
