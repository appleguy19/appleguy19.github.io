Let's get right to it. Here are the final dimensions:

**Length:** 7'
**Depth:** 22 1/8" (which includes a 3/4" split)
**Height:** 33 1/4"

It fits me quite well, but I got lucky. I knew I needed to design the workbench around the primary user (me), but I had no idea how to do that. I hoped to find someone who was roughly my height (6'2") and copy what they had done. After all, imitation is how we being the learning process (prove this, quote from Girard, perhaps?).  

What follows is how I settled on each of the key dimensions (length, depth, and height).


### Length

In my research about workbenches, I came across this [article](http://www.popularwoodworking.com/techniques/rules_for_workbenches/2). Among the many things I gleaned was this:

 >I’ve made tops that are 8′ long. My next bench will be a 10-footer, the maximum that will fit in my shop. It is difficult to make or imagine a workbench that is too long.

I didn't want to be caught with a measly 6' foot bench and an 8' project. So I measured my garage width, and estimated the available floor space along the garage's length. I figured I could only fit a 7 foot bench. Oh well, it's longer than 6. Looking back on it, I'm glad I only went with 7'. If I went with something much longer it might negate the benefits of the knockdown feature. I added the extra length to the middle of the bench, between the legs. That was an easy decision, because this random internet commenter asked [a question](https://blog.lostartpress.com/2014/09/18/materials-tools-for-the-knockdown-nicholson-workbench/#comment-27997) I didn't even know to ask!


### Depth

The depth was a little trickier because I decided to do a split top. Any change I made the to the top would cascade through the rest of the bench. I was also limited by the final width of the 2x12s. Because of this, I decided to make the leg stretchers after milling the 2 top boards. All I knew was that I wanted it around 22 inches.

### Height

I read somewhere that Chris Schwarz is about 6'3", so it was easy to just leave the bench the same height as it was in the plans. I figured that if I needed it to be taller, I could add plinths. If it were too tall, I could shorten the legs.

### If I knew then what I know now...

I would've sized it based on the information in this video.
