## Location, Location, Location

We absolutely love our neighborhood. We're one block outside of [Historic LeClaire](http://www.historic-leclaire.org). We're less than a quarter mile from two different parks, and even closer to the neighborhood elementary school (which has a playground and a kickball field, so it's basically park).

Our neighborhood and ones like it are the inspiration for [new urbanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Urbanism) havens like the popular poster-town [Seaside, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside,_Florida). Or maybe for a closer-to-home comparison with a slightly more Stepford vibe, [New Town in St. Charles, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Town,_Missouri).

## The Lot

![The Lot]({{ site.url }}/assets/content/the-lot.jpg)
When a small infill lot down the street went up for sale, we jumped on it.

### Pros

 - Great Location
 - We already know the neighborhood
 - Right down the street (*if we can recruit enough friends, we might be able to move bucket-brigade style!*)
 - Blackberry bushes
 - Four peach trees (that produce fabulous peaches)
 - Black walnut tree (depending on your disposition, this might be a con, but it produces food so it's a winner in my book)
 - Alley access (so we don't have to have a garage in the front of the house)
 - Rumor has it that there is already a tee on the water main for the house. Apparently, when the city redid the street a few years back, the previous owner made some sort of under-the-table deal with the guys putting in the water main. It *might* save us some of the $7000 tap-on fee.

### Cons

 - Apparently, there are deadman anchors extending across the property line stabilizing the north facing foundation wall of the house to our south. *Side note: apparently disclosures of known issues are not required when selling vacant land.*
 - Only 50 feet wide, which limits our design options (but I'm a perpetual optimist, so I prefer to think of [constraints as a good thing](http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/constraints-help-design/))
 - Setback requirements of 7.5 feet on each side, which limits our design options even further

## Next Steps

We're going to get a survey done to determine the property lines. We'll also use this information to determine how far from the property lines our neighbors are, just in case we need to make a case to modify the setback requirements slightly.
